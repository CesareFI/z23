 *
 * fuzz_semantic_manifest — libFuzzer harness for the semantic manifest v1
 * reader (contexts/commons/modules/vcs/src/semantic_manifest*.c,
 * docs/work/SEMANTIC_MANIFEST.md). A semantic manifest is a byte string a
 * libclang sensor writes to disk today and a future action-root consumer
 * will read from anywhere: another node, a cache, a peer. Z23 is the reader
 * only, so this harness fuzzes exactly the untrusted-input boundary: the
 * strict decoder never trusts a byte it has not validated.
 *
 * For every input this checks four properties:
 *
 *   1. The strict decoder never crashes, leaks or reads out of bounds:
 *      validate, root, hint root, every section root, facts info, and every
 *      record-walk API the header exposes (section_v1_each,
 *      manifest_v1_each, absent_v1_each).
 *   2. CANONICAL FORM MEANS EXACTLY ONE ENCODING. If the strict decoder
 *      accepts an input, this harness walks its decoded records
 *      (manifest_v1_each gives the exact record_bytes, "raw", per record)
 *      and feeds them straight back into the builder
 *      (vcs_semantic_builder_v1_add takes ready-made record bytes, per
 *      semantic_manifest_build.c's sm_add_raw) plus, when the facts
 *      extension is present, vcs_semantic_builder_v1_enable_facts with the
 *      exact caps read back via vcs_semantic_facts_v1_info. The builder
 *      sorts, deduplicates and re-validates its own output
 *      (vcs_semantic_builder_v1_finish). Since the input was already
 *      accepted by the strict decoder, it was already in canonical order;
 *      rebuilding it must therefore reproduce the identical bytes and the
 *      identical root. Anything else means the format allows two byte
 *      strings for one logical manifest, which the format's own doc
 *      ("Ordering is canonical, not normalized") says cannot happen: this
 *      harness treats that as a fatal abort, not a soft finding, so it is
 *      never silently skipped by libFuzzer.
 *   3. The dump renderer (vcs_semantic_manifest_v1_dump), run on an accepted
 *      input into a memory stream, succeeds, writes no NUL byte (its own
 *      contract: texts are hex-escaped, not embedded raw) and is
 *      deterministic across two independent calls.
 *   4. Facts info (vcs_semantic_facts_v1_info) is consistent with the
 *      sections the manifest actually carries: present iff a FACTS record
 *      exists (tag 10 has records), complete iff no TRUNCATED record
 *      (tag 15) exists, and revision is 1 or 2 exactly when present.
 *
 * If a decoded record cannot be re-expressed by the builder — a record
 * whose section the builder API refuses to accept directly (only FACTS and
 * TRUNCATED, which the builder always writes itself via finish(), never via
 * add()) — that is itself a finding: see SM_SECTION_IS_BUILDER_INTERNAL
 * below, which is the one section pair this harness does not feed back
 * through add() and instead reconstructs via enable_facts().
 *
 * Pure in-memory entry points, no sockets, deterministic per iteration.
 * Runs with -fsanitize=fuzzer,address,undefined under clang.
