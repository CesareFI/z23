# check-standalone-tools-link: every standalone tool binary the Makefile knows
# how to build must actually BUILD.
#
# Why this gate exists. `make lint`, `make test-parallel` and `make ci` between
# them build the node, the test runners, the fuzzers and two lint helpers —
# and nothing else. Every other `$(BIN_DIR)/<tool>` rule in the Makefile was
# unreachable from any gate, so those rules rotted silently: a tool kept
# compiling in the author's head and in no CI anywhere. When platform/modules/base absorbed
# logging and allocation behind forwarding headers, SIX standalone rules broke
# at once (missing -I paths, missing platform/modules/base/src/log_level.c,
# missing platform/modules/platform/src/clock.c) and every gate stayed green for it. That is
# the class this gate closes.
#
# Mechanism: the tool list is DERIVED from the Makefile, never hand-written, so
# a newly added tool is covered the day it lands. Anything the Makefile can
# build and that is not explicitly exempted below must link. The exempt set is
# small, closed, and carries a reason per entry; an unknown tool is NOT
# exempt — this gate is fail-closed by construction.
#
# Cost: the covered tools are single-translation-unit builds. ~6 s warm,
# ~70 s cold, and a no-op once built (make decides).
#
# NOTE — this is the only lint gate that EXECUTES `make`, and that is
# deliberate: a rule's -I paths and object list are only proven by actually
# compiling and linking it, which is exactly what rotted here. Three things
# make the nesting safe under the parallel lint runner: (1) the targets below
# are disjoint from the two binaries `lint:` builds as its own prerequisites
# (core_seal, check_observability_pairing), so nothing is built twice; (2) the
# node, the test runners and the fuzzers are all exempt, so no whole-program
# link is ever triggered from in here; and (3) the gen_templates step that runs
# at Makefile-parse time is content-idempotent (it writes nothing when the
# generated header is unchanged). Keep -j modest — the lint runner is already
# running its own jobs alongside this one.
#
# Mode: WARN | FAIL (controlled by ZCL_LINT_MODE; default FAIL).
set -euo pipefail

MODE="${ZCL_LINT_MODE:-FAIL}"

# --build-only: link every covered tool and stop — no verdict, no self-test,
# no prose. A landing proof runs this before it forks its lint and test
# dimensions, because this gate's nested `make` is the one thing in the lint
# dimension that relinks binaries the test dimension is reading. Deriving the
# tool list twice is how the two would drift, so the pre-build calls the gate
# that owns the derivation and asks it for the build alone; the gate still
# adjudicates, in full, inside the lint dimension where it belongs.

# with "No rule to make target", which is not a rotted rule and cannot be
# fixed by an -I path. Reason is mandatory and must name that guard.
#
# ⛔ AN EXEMPTION WITH NO REPLACEMENT CHECK IS EXACTLY THE ROT THIS GATE
# EXISTS TO STOP. So this table is not a pass on its own: each entry also
# names, in COVER below, the source file that some OTHER gate must still
