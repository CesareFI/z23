# Lint gate — the in-tree compile cache serves correct bytes (HARD).
#
# THE BUG THIS PREVENTS. tools/zcc.c wraps every compile in this repository.
# Its first version keyed its fast path on the stat triples of the files named
# on the command line, which does not include headers: editing a header left
# the .c file's (size, mtime, inode) untouched, so the cache served the OLD
# object and the build silently produced a binary that did not match the
# source. A compile cache that can do that is worse than no cache, because
# every downstream proof in this project is a statement about bytes.
#
# This gate exercises unchanged, edited, and concurrent builds. It requires
# identical bytes when nothing changed, different bytes when a
# header changed, warnings replayed on a hit, and a real hit actually taken
# (a cache that misses every time would pass a correctness-only test while
# quietly costing every developer the speed this exists for).
#
# Everything happens in a mktemp dir with ZCC_DIR pointed inside it, so the
# gate never reads or writes the developer's real cache.

set -euo pipefail

# The proof builds cold with ZCC_VERIFIED, but this fixture first tests the
# ordinary cache and sets proof mode explicitly for its refusal cases.
