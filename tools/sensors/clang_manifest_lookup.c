 * The scan's invariant: every occurrence of a lookup word in the text of
 * any file the TU reads (a system header's too: its angled searches start
 * at the repo's -I dirs) ends with a record, unless clang's own tokens,
 * outside a skipped group, show it is none (cm_floor_file). A word clang
 * lexes as a lookup token (clang_manifest_tokens.c) is replayed where the
 * scan can: a __has_include whose operand is a literal "x" or <x>, or an
 * object-like repo macro every definition of which is one plain string
 * literal (the front end's recorded expansion at that offset names the
 * definition; facts manifests only, since only they keep expansions), and
 * a __has_include_next from the slot after each one its file was entered
 * through (cm_entry_add), or, in a system header, from the start and after
 * each search dir that could hold it (cm_cond_next_system); the producer
 * runs the search itself and stat-confirms every probe (REPLAYED_STAT),
 * and the slots before the start are recorded present, with no claim.
 * Every other occurrence - another operand, __has_embed, the GNU
 * __has_include__ words, #embed, an include_next start no slot names, one
 * a line continuation or trigraph runs through, a word in any #define body
 * or -D value, a word not followed by its '(' (an alias's body), one in a
 * skipped group, a header name or #warning or #error text, and, once for
 * the TU, words some ## could paste into a lookup word
 * (cm_core.paste_piece) - is recorded with no negative claim
 * (MISS_V1_NONE), spelled from "#embed" or "__has_embed" on, so the facts
 * consumer treats it as reachable by every changed path. Precision
 * failures only ever widen. The sensor refuses every -X pass-through,
 * -Wp,, front-end plugins and MSVC compatibility,
 * whose -D, -std or trigraph rules the scan cannot read, and a TU where a
 * lookup token clang lexes is not the word the scan reads at its offset.
 * The scan reads each word's operand in the text as translation phases 1
 * and 2 leave it (cm_splice, with the trigraph rule cm_measure_lang
 * measured for the TU).
