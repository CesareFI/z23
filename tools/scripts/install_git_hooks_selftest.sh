# install_git_hooks_selftest.sh — the three properties tools/scripts/
# install_git_hooks.sh has to hold, proved against real Git in a throwaway
# repository, never against this checkout's own configuration.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The installer used to run an UNSCOPED
# `git config --unset-all core.hooksPath`, which git resolves to the SHARED
# .git/config, and then wrote an ABSOLUTE replacement into the invoking
# worktree's own config.worktree. Running the documented `make setup` in a
# second worktree therefore disarmed every worktree that had been relying on
# the shared value, silently — a push that should have been refused went
# through instead. The repository carried a standing rule telling developers
# not to run its own documented command. This is the executable half of
# retiring that rule:
#
#   A. installing in one worktree changes NO other worktree's effective
#      core.hooksPath, and leaves a pre-existing SHARED value untouched;
#   B. the installed value is the relative `build/githooks`, and Git really
#      does resolve a relative core.hooksPath against the worktree that runs
#      the hook — so one spelling is correct in every worktree at once;
#   C. a second run is a no-op: byte-identical config, exit 0.
#
# Read-only with respect to this checkout: every write lands under a
# mktemp -d scratch directory that is removed on exit.
