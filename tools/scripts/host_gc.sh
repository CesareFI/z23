# Host garbage collector — keeps the maintainer box clean without a human.
#
# DRY-RUN BY DEFAULT. Nothing is removed, moved, killed, or capped unless
# --apply is passed. `--status` prints one screen of host hygiene facts and
# exits without touching anything.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The box grew to 281 GB of ~/github with no cap on any
# cache and no watcher on free space. The single largest consumer was a
# directory nothing on the host knew how to reclaim: `.z23p`, the proof
# generation pool created by tools/dev/dev_proof.c (see CATEGORY z23p below).
# The pre-existing timers each guard one narrow thing — worktree_gc.sh
# classifies named worktrees, test-tmp-clean sweeps scratch, logrotate
# rotates logs. Nobody capped ccache, nobody capped the zcc cache, nobody
# reaped a detached proof generation, and nobody noticed the disk filling.
# This script is the missing whole-host sweep; it does NOT reimplement the
# parts that already work, it calls them.
#
# WHAT IT WILL NEVER TOUCH (hard protect list, enforced in is_protected()
# and re-checked immediately before every destructive action):
#
#   $HOME/.zclassic*             live datadirs (~215 GB) and every sibling
#   $HOME/.zclassic-c23-backups  block/db backups
#   $HOME/wallet_backups         wallet custody
#   $HOME/.zcash-params          proving/verifying keys
#   $HOME/.ssh                   host keys
#   $HOME/.config/zclassic23     node configuration
#   $HOME/github/zclassic23      the main checkout itself
#   $HOME/.local/state/zclassic23-quality/*   registered quality checkouts
#   /tmp/zcl-pristine-*          registered pristine reference checkout
#   anything under systemd management, and the live node's process tree
#
# The protect list is a PREFIX test on a resolved absolute path, so a
# symlink or a `..` cannot walk into a protected tree and out again.
#
# QUARANTINE, NOT DELETE. Anything that is not a pure cache or build output
# is MOVED to $STATE/quarantine/<date>/ rather than unlinked, and swept 14
# days later. Caches and build outputs are exempt because they are, by
# definition, reproducible by rerunning the build — quarantining 49 GB of
# ccache would defeat the purpose of capping it.
#
# EVERY ACTION LOGS ONE LINE to $STATE/host_gc.log with the bytes it
# reclaimed, so "what did the janitor do last night" is one `tail` away and
# the byte totals in any report can be re-derived from the log rather than
# trusted.
#
# CATEGORIES (-a..-i map to the sweep order below):
#   ccache   cap ccache to 20 GB and collect
#   zcc      trim the zcc compile cache to 15 GB with its own evictor
#   z23p     reap dead dev-proof generations (the 158 GB leak) on the disk
#            pool AND on its tmpfs twin, which grew to 34 GB of RAM in one
#            unattended day while nothing here was looking at it
#   tmp      registered worktrees under /tmp
#   tmplitter unregistered /tmp test fixtures (no worktree behind them)
#   journal  vacuum the user journal to 512 MB
#   binbak   quarantine ~/bin/*.bak-* older than 60 days
#   testtmp  stale test scratch in idle worktrees
#   orphan   kill parentless processes whose checkout was deleted
#   deadexec WARN on user units whose ExecStart is missing or inside build/
#   worktree merged+clean named worktrees, via worktree_gc.sh --apply
#   units    landed units/lanes/trains, by PATCH equivalence (git cherry),
#            not ancestry — catches cherry-picked lanes worktree_gc.sh can't
#   scratch  scratch dirs whose owning worktree is gone; .gc_keep pins one
#   pressure not a sweep: reports free-space % and halves every age floor
#            above it when low, prints top dirs under $GC_HOME when critical
#
# FIXTURE MODE. Every host-global path and external binary is indirected
# through a ZCL_HOST_GC_* variable so tools/lint/check_host_gc.sh can run
# the whole sweep against a throwaway HOME and prove each category fires and
# each protected path survives. Production runs set none of them.

usage: tools/scripts/host_gc.sh [--apply] [--dry-run] [--status] [--only CAT]

Sweep the maintainer host for reclaimable space. DRY-RUN by default: every
category is classified and the reclaimable byte total is printed, but
nothing is removed, moved, or killed.

  --apply        execute the sweep (removals, quarantine moves, kills)
  --dry-run      classify and report only (the default)
  --status       print one screen of host hygiene facts and exit
  --only CAT     run a single category. CAT is one of:
                 ccache zcc z23p tmp tmplitter journal binbak testtmp orphan
                 deadexec worktree units scratch wtbuild landtmp landed lowdisk
  --wt-build-idle-h=N      hours an idle worktree's build/ output is kept (12)
  --reap-landed-worktrees  also remove clean, fully landed, idle worktrees

Thresholds: below the low-disk floor the sweep relaxes its age floors (idle
worktree build/ output: 2h) and, after the sweep, posts one agent-mail
warning naming the largest consumers (at most once per 6h); below the
cache-freeze floor the caches are also capped at their current size so they
cannot reclaim the space the sweep just freed.

# =============================================================== CATEGORY zcc
# The zcc cache has a real evictor of its own (`zcc --zcc-trim MB`, the same
# eviction the cache performs on itself). Using it rather than an atime sort
# keeps ONE eviction policy: an external sweeper deleting entries the cache
# still believes it owns is how a cache index goes stale.
#
# ONE WALK PER RUN. `du -sb` over a multi-million-file cache is expensive on
# a rotational box: measured on a fleet HDD host 2026-09-10, the hourly unit
# ran 18:49-19:19 (30 min wall, 1.9s CPU, all I/O wait) with the `du -sb --
# ~/.cache/zcc` call alone sitting 27 min in D state, holding
# /proc/pressure/io avg10 at 60-67% for the whole hour and starving the live
# node — even with Nice=19 + IOSchedulingClass=idle, which does not help a
# seek-bound HDD. The evictor (`zcc --zcc-trim`) already walks the tree once
# to do the eviction and prints what it found in its own report line
# ("zcc: N MB held, N MB ceiling, N MB freed"); the APPLY path below reads
# THAT line instead of measuring the directory again, so a normal apply run
# costs exactly the evictor's one walk, never du before AND after it.
# Dry-run still needs the current size before the evictor runs at all, so it
# keeps exactly one measurement of its own — never a second on top of it.
# A cache FREEZE on the apply path is recorded from the evictor's held
# figure, never measured first: trimming to min(held, cap) frees exactly
# what trimming to cap frees, so the freeze changes the log row, not the
# eviction, and buying it with a walk of its own would put the second walk
# back on every low-disk box.

# ============================================================== CATEGORY z23p
# THE LEAK. tools/dev/dev_proof.c:generation_prepare() creates one detached
# worktree per (checkout, commit) pair under <parent-of-checkout>/.z23p, keyed
# by a hash of both, and NEVER removes one. The push hook proves every commit
# pair, so the pool grows by a ~2 GB worktree every few minutes and nothing
# on the host had the authority to reclaim it: `git worktree prune` finds
# nothing because every generation is still correctly registered.
#
# THE POOL COMES IN TWO HALVES. dev_proof.c builds a generation in RAM when
# RAM scratch is reserved and on disk otherwise, so both are swept here: the
# disk pool by the classifier below, the tmpfs twin by `z23 ops host gc`
# when a binary is available (it finds the repository behind a generation
# from the generation itself, so it sees twins this script's single GC_REPO
# listing cannot) and by the same classifier when none is.
#
# A generation is reapable when ALL of these hold:
#   older than Z23P_MIN_AGE_H     (a proof in flight is minutes old)
#   no process has it as cwd      (a proof in flight is chdir'd into it)
#   not git-locked                (an explicit "leave this alone")
#   detached HEAD and clean       (git's own verdict, not ours)
# Anything failing the last test is REPORTED, never removed — a generation
# holding uncommitted content is a bug worth a human's attention, not a
# deletion candidate.
# A generation directory left behind by dev_proof.c may carry a top-level
# *.lock/*.pid file naming the pid that created it (state layout is an
# internal detail of dev_proof.c and may not always be present — this is a
# best-effort check, never the only reason a generation is kept). When one
# exists and names a pid that is gone, the creator is PROVABLY dead and the

# that is alive, the generation is kept regardless of age.

# reached 97% full with ~230 GB of obj/bin/toolchain trees spread over ~140
# lane worktrees nobody had built in for days, while every category above

# open file, or its executable inside it, or when anything under its build/
# changed within the idle window (WT_BUILD_IDLE_H, default 12h; 2h below the
# low-disk floor). Inside an idle worktree these build/ children survive:
#   evidence   scratch, handoff, devverify, clang-facts, and any name with
#              stopwatch, acceptance, evidence or receipt in it
#   hidden     .locks, markers and leases: tiny, and live build machinery
#   bin        when a systemd user unit's ExecStart points into it (and
#              whenever the unit list cannot be read at all: fail closed)

# removes a checkout's build/ directory; any linger unit whose ExecStart
# pointed into that build/ dies with 203/EXEC and STAYS dead, because
# nothing on the host was watching for it. Two units on this host died
# exactly this way and one of them was a probe, so its silence was read as a
# real fault and paged for more than a day. A janitor that can create this
# failure mode is obliged to detect it.
#
# REPORT ONLY, in every run including --apply. Disabling somebody's unit
# automatically is not hygiene, it is an outage with extra steps. The output
# is a WARN a human or an agent acts on.
#
# The policy this enforces by naming violations: no unit may point into a
# checkout's build/ directory. Build trees are disposable by design;
# installed binaries belong under the user's own lib tree.
