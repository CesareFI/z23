/* ---- make inputs: the paths the makefile text names ---------------------------- */

/* Make reads a path when a makefile names it: its own name, a literal path
 * or basename, a directory it lives under (with or without a trailing '/':
 * a bare directory handed to a recipe's tool is as much a mention as one
 * spelled with the slash), or a glob or pattern ('*', '?', '[...]', '%')
 * outside a whole-line comment, also under a root the text cannot expand
 * ($(CURDIR)/x). A path-like variable (one definition, no whitespace) is
 * expanded, any other reference matches anything, and a function call is
 * its arguments. What the text cannot be read for is UNKNOWN, and UNKNOWN
 * is a make input.
 *
 * Only a mention where make can change an object with the path counts
 * (docs/work/SEMANTIC_MANIFEST.md, "Build inputs make reads"): every
 * definition, directive and conditional; the rule line and recipe of a
 * reached rule; and a recipe line that can run make. A rule is reached when
 * a target is not a literal .PHONY name (it can build a file), when it is a
 * makefile's first rule (a bare make's goal), or when a .PHONY name of it
 * is spelled by a line that reaches: a directive, the prerequisites of a
 * reached rule, its recipe lines that run make, and the definition of a
 * live variable (one those lines reference or spell). What a line only
 * tests or prints (an $(if) condition, a $(filter) pattern, an $(error)
 * message, an echo) reaches nothing but what runs as it is expanded. An
 * unreached .PHONY rule runs only as a goal someone asks for, and then in
 * full: what it reads is a prerequisite of no object. '%' is a make pattern
 * only in make's own text: in a recipe line or a $(shell) argument it is
 * shell text and matches nothing. A recipe line a conditional leaves
 * without one rule counts, and so does every recipe line under .ONESHELL
 * or .RECIPEPREFIX. */
