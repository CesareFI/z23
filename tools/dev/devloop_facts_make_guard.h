/* A missing optional include is made (UNKNOWN) only when make reads its
 * include line. One the root makefile reads only inside a branch that is
 * provably not taken is skipped: ifneq (A,B) fails and ifeq (A,B) holds
 * when both sides provably expand to nothing. "Provably" is a reading that
 * only ever errs toward "may expand to something": each text expands to a
 * bounded set of alternatives, or to any text (any) when it holds a
 * function the reading does not model, a variable with a ?=, +=, != or
 * define, one another file, a target-specific value, an $(eval) or an
 * undefine can set, one no line assigns (the environment's), one that no
 * branch before the directive surely assigned, or a $(shell) other than
 * the compile epoch's. A variable several branches assign holds the union
 * of their values. $(wildcard) globs the tree the plan reads (empty, or
 * any text). What the reading rests on beyond the text is a named premise
 * (ZCL_DEVLOOP_PREMISE_*): two on every skip, the goals' or the epoch's
 * where it reads them, recorded with the paths it globbed. A reading whose
 * globbed path a command make runs as it reads names is not used. */
