 * purpose: Derive, sign, and verify the per-pair mandatory coverage
 *          manifest that binds executed test groups to eligible signed
 *          observations.
 *
 * The canonical lifecycle (docs/work/CANONICAL_LIFECYCLE.md, PROOF_SET)
 * separates reusable input keys from immutable observation roots: coverage
 * binds the mandatory input keys derived for a candidate and the receiver's
 * eligibility basis. An explicit observation run emits one signed verdict-leaf
 * observation per qualified executed group into a durable per-pair CAS
 * (see dev_proof_observation.h). What was missing
 * is the object that proves WHICH groups a pair's receipt actually executed
 * and that every one of them is either backed by eligible PASS evidence
 * with no preserved contradiction or named as unqualified. That is this
 * manifest.
 *
 * A producer derives and signs it; a receiver re-verifies it against the
 * receipt's executed-group count and its own enumeration of the same
 * store. Wiring the two into the proof worker and the pre-push hook waits
 * until the default proof emits observations. Both sides run the same
 * bounded verification over the same private CAS, so a producer cannot omit
 * a known eligible contradiction and a corrupted or replayed manifest is
 * named, never silently re-derived.
 *
 * Wire shapes are versioned apart from layout, exactly like the pair
 * receipt: the manifest is admitted only under the policy version stamped
 * into it, and an older or newer producer is named instead of misread. */
