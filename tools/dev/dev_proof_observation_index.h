 * purpose: Box-level receiver index of signed observation leaves.
 *
 * Canonical lifecycle item 3 (docs/work/FORWARD_PLAN.md): reuse of
 * unchanged unit evidence across candidates is permitted "only when its
 * exact input closure and receiver policy permit it". The receiver's half
 * of that contract is a durable, verified, receiver-local basis of
 * observations seen on this box — the index the reuse admission and the
 * coverage queries classify against.
 *
 * After a proof publishes, the worker merges the pair's durable observation
 * CAS into this index. Every row is a self-verifying (root, wire) pair:
 * the root re-derives from the wire, so a tampered row is named on read
 * and never silently re-derived. Contradictory and ineligible leaves are
 * preserved, not collapsed: classification time refuses unresolved
 * eligible conflicts, exactly like the per-pair projection.
 *
 * The index is a rebuildable projection, not authority: merge failures are
 * named and reported but never block an already-proven publication. */
