 * links. It runs alongside the test dimension on purpose: three measured
 * landing-shaped proofs on a 32-core box under concurrent lane traffic
 * (2026-09-06) put all 202 gates at 373 s, 507 s and 670 s of wall time
 * against 188-230 s for the tests, so lint is always the longer of the two
 * and running it first would simply add the test dimension to every
 * landing. The cold check-standalone-tools-link inside those generations
 * was 118 s, 120 s and 636 s -- the last of them the whole lint run's
 * single largest item. Thirty minutes is about 2.6x the slowest total
 * observed, and a budget only ends a step that has ALSO gone silent for
 * PROOF_NO_PROGRESS_MS, which a run printing a gate line every few seconds
 * does not. The proof writes its measured wall time into the phases file
 * as lint_wall_ms beside the lint_targets line, so the next reader
 * replaces this number rather than trusting it. */

 * tools check-standalone-tools-link links -- 118 s, 120 s and 636 s in the
 * three measured landing-shaped generations above. That work is moved, not
 * new: it used to run inside the lint dimension, concurrently with the test
 * dimension reading the same binaries. The landing allowance matches the
