# Executable regression for tools/dev/commons_journey_acceptance.sh ordering.
#
# A peer-dependent wait must never run before the peers it depends on have
# been started and their connections attempted. A node with no peer cannot
# leave finding_peers and its build worker cannot admit work, so asking
# before then is waiting on work the harness itself has not done yet: the
# wait burns its whole budget and dies, every run, for a reason that has
# nothing to do with the product.
#
# This is a STATIC check of the script's control flow. It starts no nodes and
# proves no runtime behaviour: a fixture may test harness ordering, it cannot
# substitute for real acceptance.
