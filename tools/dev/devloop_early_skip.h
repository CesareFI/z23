/* FEEDBACK ONLY, like the early stage it narrows (devloop_early.h). Nothing
 * here touches the full plan, its receipt, the test cache or the
 * failure-first store; the full plan still runs every group it selects.
 *
 * KEY. key(G) is SHA3-256 over
 *     "zcl.dev_early_skip.key.v1\n" "identity:<identity>\n" "group:<G>\n"
 * then one "<path>:<SHA3-256 of the file's bytes>\n" line per closure file
 * in byte order of path. It follows the commuting-ticket key
 * (docs/agent/COMMUTING_TICKETS.md) with two deliberate differences: file
 * bytes come from the working tree the candidate was compiled from, not
 * from a committed tip, and headers are resolved the way the compiler
 * resolves them. dev.agent.ticketkey keys the committed blobs at a tip (the
 * edit this stage answers is not committed), resolves a quoted include by
 * basename only (so "json/json.h" silently joins nothing), and routes every
 * blob of the tree through the shared rules (about 50 s cold per process).
 *
 * CLOSURE of an early group G:
 *   - its test file: tests/harness/src/<G>.c for a test_ id, and
 *     tests/harness/spec/<G>.c for a spec_ id;
 *   - every restart source attributed to G: the per-source facts plan names
 *     G, or that source's plan could not narrow (then it counts for every
 *     group);
 *   - every file those include, transitively: a quoted name in the
 *     includer's directory, then each -iquote directory, then each -I
 *     directory of the candidate's compile flags; an angle name in the -I
 *     directories only (not found there: a system header, outside the key).
 *
 * IDENTITY is SHA3-256 over the harness version, the compiler id, the base
 * generation, and the test compile flags, link flags and libraries. Any of
 * them changing reruns every group.
 *
 * UNVOUCHED. A group whose inputs this key cannot see is never skipped and
 * never recorded: no conventional test file; an unregistered group or one
 * that declares a host need (tools/dev/test_group_host_needs.def); a test
 * file that reads the environment, starts a process, or names a checkout
 * path in a string literal (runtime data and fixtures); a quoted include
 * that resolves nowhere, a computed include, or an unreadable file; no
 * attributed source; a closure or source set past its bound. Without a
 * toolchain identity nothing is skipped or recorded.
 *
 * MODES (ZCL_DEVLOOP_EARLY_SKIP_ENV): unset or "on" skips; "off" skips
 * nothing, for A/B measurement, and still records passes; "verify" decides
 * exactly as "on", then runs the skipped groups anyway in a second uncached
 * process and counts every failure there as a false narrow. Any other value
 * is "off".
 *
 * STORE. ZCL_DEVLOOP_EARLY_SKIP_STORE under the checkout root: a header
 * line, then "<group>\t<key>\t<identity>\t<candidate sha256>\t<run us>\n"
 * per group, replaced whole through a temporary file and a rename. A store
 * that does not parse is treated as empty. */
