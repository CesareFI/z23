/* Copyright 2026 Rhett Creighton - Apache License 2.0
 * purpose: One build worker's durable proof state on the production path:
 *          start-time recovery, the signed issuer log, the receiver rebuilt
 *          from CAS under the worker table's trust policy, per-execution
 *          ticket publication, and the feedback-only reuse shadow.
 *
 * The context is an explicit object the runtime owns and passes to each
 * step; no library function reads it from hidden global state. It holds the
 * issuer seed for its lifetime and wipes it on close.
 *
 * Tickets are FEEDBACK ONLY here. Attach's donor scan remains the reuse
 * authority; the shadow computes the ticket decision next to every attach
 * decision and counts whether the two agree. */
