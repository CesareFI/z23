/* catchup_lifecycle_service — start / ownership-join / poll-reap for the
 * node_db catchup job (struct node_db_sync_catchup_job,
 * controllers/sync_controller.h).
 *
 * Lifted out of engine/composition/src/boot_services.c (boot_start_catchup_service /
 * boot_join_catchup_service / boot_reap_catchup_service), which took
 * `struct boot_svc_ctx *` — a engine/composition/src-internal type ("Not for use
 * outside engine/composition/src/", see config/boot_internal.h) that has no business
 * leaking into engine/services/. These take the job + its inputs directly:
 * boot_services.c and boot_background_workers.c keep extracting
 * node_db/chain/wallet/datadir from `svc` and pass them through, so the
 * two call sites stay thin while the lifecycle POLICY (double-start
 * guard, ownership-preserving join, poll-only reap) lives in
 * one place next to the job it manages.
 *
 * Kept as its own file rather than folded into node_db_catchup_service.c:
 * that file is already well past the E1 800-line target, and the job
 * *lifecycle* (thread spawn/join bookkeeping) is a distinct concern from
 * the job *body* (the block-index catchup algorithm in
 * node_db_catchup_service_run) anyway — so it earns its own file on
 * cohesion grounds, not just size. */
