 * boot_node_db_gate — names a typed blocker when node.db fails to open.
 * See config/boot_internal.h for the declaration.
 *
 * Every other boot-storage gate (crypto_params_missing, coins_view_integrity,
 * progress_kv_open) names a typed blocker when its storage fails to open.
 * An unopenable node.db is a PERMANENT blocker: a bounded retry cannot fix it,
 * it needs an operator to look at disk/permissions/corruption.
 *
 * This gate fires at stage crypto_ready: no RPC bound, serving=false,
 * boot_status.json blocker=node_db_unopened. A parked process there answers
 * nothing and sends no READY=, so it REFUSES rather than parks: close the open
 * "db.open_migrate" step as `failed` (the only producer of verdict=failure),
 * then exit non-zero naming the one command the operator runs. systemd reports
 * failed and Restart= owns the retry.
 *
 * THE REPAIR RUNS FIRST. A malformed node.db does not reach this gate:
 * models/database.c quarantines the SQLite family and rebuilds fresh (see
 * db_build_schema there). Reaching this gate means the store could not be
 * opened even after that repair. */
