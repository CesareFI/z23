 * ACCEPTANCE BAR for the facts-narrowed change closure against a cold
 * compiler: a differential fuzzer. Each case is a small multi-TU C23
 * project before and after one edit, either generated from a seed
 * (semantic_fuzz_gen.c, deterministic from seed and profile) or one of the
 * fixed reproducers (semantic_fuzz_repro.c), every one of which runs every
 * time. For each case every TU is compiled (the clang of the LLVM the
 * sensor links, -std=c23 -O1 -ffunction-sections, the project's flags) and
 * sensed (build/bin/z23-clang-manifest emit --facts) on both sides, the
 * change set is planned in process from the facts directory exactly as
 * dev.change.plan {"facts":...} plans it, and two oracles judge the plan:
 *
 *   objects     every TU the plan leaves unaffected (or out of its
 *               universe) has a byte-identical object;
 *   symbols     in a changed object, every function and data object
 *               whose bytes changed, or whose relocations now address
 *               other content (a relocation into a section or a local
 *               symbol is resolved to the string, constant or object
 *               bytes it addresses; an addend that resolves to the same
 *               content does not count), is a seed of a narrowed plan by
 *               canonical id (or is covered by a fallback, or by a
 *               broadened TU after a header change), and so is every other
 *               symbol at its address.
 *
 * A false negative prints the case (seed, profile, mutation), the TU and
 * the function, and fails. Every fixed reproducer (semantic_fuzz_repro.c,
 * known-RED and pass guards alike) runs every time regardless of mode:
 * they are the regressions this group exists to catch. On top of those,
 * three seed modes, printed in the summary line as `mode=...`:
 *   default   a fixed list of 6 seeds (~60s standalone with the fixed
 *             reproducers on an unloaded host) covering every mutation
 *             kind and every profile;
 *   full      ZCL_STRESS_TESTS=1 (this repo's existing opt-in-to-the-slow-
 *             path convention): the full fixed list of 51 seeds;
 *   custom    ZCL_SEMANTIC_FUZZ_SEEDS=FIRST:COUNT[:PROFILE[:KIND[:CC[:OPT]]]]
 *             runs a long range instead (PROFILE all, no-ctr-line or
 *             gcc-deps; KIND forces one mutation kind, any draws it; CC
 *             names the object compiler, BEFORE>AFTER one that drifts
 *             between the sides; OPT replaces -O1), and wins over
 *             ZCL_STRESS_TESTS.
 * Both the default and full seed lists must yield narrowed plans that seed
 * a changed function, so the group cannot pass on fallbacks alone; a
 * custom range is not held to that (it may deliberately probe a
 * fallback-only slice). Cases run in
 * forked children, SFZ_CASES_AT_ONCE at once, each handing its outcome
 * back over a pipe; reports print in case order. Self-skips,
 * visibly, where the sensor has not been built (`make clang-manifest`),
 * where no clang sits beside the libclang it links, or where the sensor is
 * not ELF. A reproducer marked known-RED names the fix it waits for and the
 * exact false-negative lines it reports until then: it holds only when it
 * fails with exactly those lines. Any other outcome fails the group: an
 * ERROR, another miss, or a PASS (the mark is stale and must go). A fixed
 * reproducer or default seed whose edit changes no file (NOOP) fails too;
 * only a ZCL_SEMANTIC_FUZZ_SEEDS range run may draw one.
