/* A semantic manifest records what a compiler front end saw in one
 * translation unit: its compiler/target/argv/search-list identity, every
 * file it read (by content), include lookups with their negative probes,
 * repo macros, declarations, record layouts, enum values, function
 * definitions (by token hash) and their source spans. The optional facts
 * extension (sections 10-15) adds canonical symbols, direct reference edges,
 * explicit UNKNOWN effects, snapshot namespace probes and truncation records.
 * Any producer (the libclang sensor in tools/sensors/, or a future native
 * Z23 front end) emits the same bytes;
 * this module is the only reader and has no compiler dependency. The byte
 * format is specified in docs/work/SEMANTIC_MANIFEST.md:
 *
 *   manifest = MAGIC || section(1) || ... || section(9)
 *              [ || section(10) || ... || section(15) ]   (facts extension)
 *   section  = u8 tag || u32le payload_len || payload
 *   payload  = u32le record_count || record*
 *   record   = u32le record_len || record_bytes
 *   root         = SHA3-256(VCS_SEMANTIC_ROOT_V1_DOMAIN || manifest)
 *   section_root = SHA3-256(VCS_SEMANTIC_SECTION_ROOT_V1_DOMAIN || u8 tag
 *                           || payload)
 *
 * Every section is present exactly once in tag order. Records inside a
 * section are strictly increasing by memcmp over record_bytes (a proper
 * prefix sorts first), so a duplicate is refused, never normalized. The
 * identity section holds exactly one record. Paths are repo-relative or
 * "@sys/..." (system/sysroot); no absolute host path, mtime, hostname or
 * uid can be represented. */

/* The negative half of a compile's include resolution, so a consumer can
 * check it against a later namespace. cb is called with:
 *   - (dir, name) for every LOOKUPS slot below the hit that present_slots
 *     does not list: the compile saw no dir/name there. Slot 0 of a quoted
 *     lookup is the includer's directory ("." at the top), then the quote
 *     dirs, then the angled dirs; an angled lookup has the angled dirs only.
 *   - (dir, NULL) for every IDENTITY ignored dir: it did not exist.
 *   - (NULL, name) for a lookup that makes no negative claim (include_next,
 *     a computed or an absolute include): nothing about it can be checked.
 * Dirs are manifest paths ("." , repo-relative or "@sys/..."); texts are not
 * NUL-terminated. False for an invalid manifest, a slot outside the search
 * list, or when cb returns false. */
