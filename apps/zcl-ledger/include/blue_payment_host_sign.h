/* Requires 1..16 inputs and protocol 12/capability 31, then collects
 * signatures in input order. Every reply is checked against its expected
 * path, public-key hash, and ZIP-243 digest. Verified replies remain private
 * until every input passes; callbacks cannot alter an earlier returned reply.
 * Expectations are frozen before identity and approval callbacks. If caller
 * storage differs after a callback, the function rejects all signatures and
 * attempts a review abort. The caller keeps all arrays alive and prevents
 * concurrent writes.
 * Once bounded arguments are accepted, identity, approval, transport, or
 * verification failure attempts to abort the device review, then clears
 * every output slot, including signatures already obtained. Invalid arguments
 * also request an abort when an exchange callback is available. The output
 * array must not overlap the expected paths, hashes, or digests; rejected
 * overlap leaves trusted input bytes untouched and makes no signing request.
 * Callers must
 * ignore output slots after any failure. No broadcast occurs. */
