# Architecture North Star — one ledger per domain, views only

Use this page to distinguish proven headers from derived state, identify
duplicate writable facts, and judge what the regression evidence establishes.
Here, a ledger holds verified facts, a frontier is its folded progress, and a
view reads those facts without maintaining an independently writable copy.
Before changing sync, boot, import, install, or frontier code, inspect the
relevant source in your checkout and the evidence limits below. This page is
the design target, not proof that the whole tree conforms to it.

## Verdict: RESCUE, not rewrite

The core is correct and expensive: frozen consensus verifiers (Equihash,
Sapling), the append-only log + reducer frontier, peer-to-peer (P2P)/Tor, the
swarm download engine, the bundle format. A rewrite re-earns every parity lesson
(h=478544, BLS infinity, the golden values) to arrive at this same design
with fresh bugs. **The disease is confined to ~5 seams** (import, install,
legacy paths). Fix the seams; keep the core.

## The one bug, every time

Not "too many acquisition paths" (a sovereign node MUST keep genesis-fold as
its trust root). Not "one log would fix it" (that erases the two distinct
trust mechanisms below). The actual disease:

> **A single fact ("header proven to H", "state applied to H") has two or
> three independently-writable copies. One writer updates copy A; a reader
> checks copy B; they disagree.**

The D8 defect that established this rule: `--importblockindex` verified the
headers' proof of work (PoW) and wrote `pindex_best_header = 3.19M`, but the
install gate read the *other* copy (the `validate_headers` stage cursor = 0),
so it deferred forever
and the node folded from genesis. Same fact, two copies, drift.

## Two provenance domains — keep them SEPARATE and VISIBLE

State is trusted by two different mechanisms. PoW establishes the header
spine: hash-linked headers with verified PoW. Derived state is the
UTXO (unspent transaction output), anchor (commitment-tree root), and nullifier
(spend-detection identifier) sets earned by replaying block bodies.
A checkpoint is a borrowed state snapshot at height C;
it is meaningful only if the header at C has real PoW and chains to genesis.
Never flatten these domains into one number: their difference is the
sovereignty audit trail.

| Domain | Direction and cost | What establishes it |
|---|---|---|
| Header spine | Top-down, cheap | Hash-linked headers with verified PoW. |
| Derived state | Bottom-up, expensive | Bundle assertion or genesis replay. |

A bundle asserts state at C when its hash matches the baked root; replay from
genesis derives it.

Every derived-state row must carry a `self_derived | checkpoint` tag.
The existing `rewind_bases` diagnostic view exposes a `self_derived` boolean
for its enumerated bases. "Is my tip earned or borrowed?" must be answerable.

## Acquisition is a fall-through STACK, not competitors

No ad-hoc "which path wins" precedence. Try in order; each layer that
succeeds appends the SAME facts to the SAME ledgers:

1. verified bundle (fast) → binds if the header spine reaches C
2. swarm bodies from a peer at the checkpoint (medium)
3. genesis fold (slow, sovereign floor — NEVER deleted)

Checkpoint installation is a labeled splice:

1. Wait for the verified header spine to reach C.
2. Graft the asserted checkpoint state at C.
3. Replay block bodies across the gap from C to the tip.

## The invariants a future LLM MUST obey

1. **Single writer per frontier.** Each frontier (`header_frontier`,
   `state_frontier`, and any shielded sub-frontier) has exactly ONE code
   path that advances it: appending a verified fact to its ledger. If you
   are about to write a height/cursor anywhere else, STOP — you are creating
   a cloned ledger. Make it a view instead.
2. **Readers read the frontier fold, never a side cursor.** Install gate,
   `status`, self-heal, and boot decisions all read the reducer frontier.
   `pindex_best_header` and `coins applied-height` are VIEWS; never gate on
   them independently.
3. **Reconcile at explicit points only.** The header/state domains meet at
   the checkpoint splice and nowhere else. No ad-hoc "if A disagrees with B"
   patches — that smell means two copies exist that shouldn't.
4. **A stall is always a named blocker with a height.** A frontier cannot
   fail to advance without a typed blocker naming why. No silent spins
   (see D7: the Sapling rebuild livelock that logged nothing).
5. **No hidden O(chain) work at boot.** If the bundle ships complete state
   (incl. shielded tree), nothing rebuilds. Boot is O(1) + fold-the-gap.
6. **Fix by DELETING a redundant copy, not adding a guard.** If your change
   reconciles two representations of one fact, you are treating the symptom.
   Demote one of them to a view.

## Regression evidence

The architecture decision is settled; whole-tree conformance is not yet
proved. `tools/scripts/check_frontier_single_writer.sh` delegates to the
native `build/bin/z23-lint check-frontier-single-writer` gate. It reads
`tools/scripts/arch_frontier_owners.tsv` and, for each declared row, requires
exactly one file with the owner basename under its configured scan roots.
It refuses a matched `.c` or `.h` file outside that owner unless the path is
in `tools/scripts/frontier_single_writer_baseline.tsv`, but skips test-shaped
paths and every `*/include/*` path. The gate rejects stale baseline rows;
repository policy requires review before adding a new row, but the gate cannot
prove that history property. This is useful
source-shape evidence only for the declared regular expressions and non-skipped
paths. It cannot establish runtime reachability, serialization through the
owner, target database identity, dynamic-key writes, production headers under
an include directory, or that every durable chain fact has a manifest row.

<!-- claim: gate-passes check-frontier-single-writer # declared frontier patterns have no unbaselined match on the gate's non-skipped paths -->
<!-- claim: file-present tools/scripts/arch_frontier_owners.tsv # the gate's complete declared frontier set -->

`code provenance facts` complements that narrow gate by deriving resolved
named-literal mutation sites for `progress_meta`, `stage_cursor`, and
`node_state`. It deliberately reports completeness, runtime reachability,
authority roles, database identity, serialization, and duplicate fact homes as
`UNPROVEN`; multiple source files are audit leads, not proof of multiple owners.

Therefore the current evidence supports these narrower statements:

| Question | Current evidence |
|---|---|
| Does a declared frontier pattern gain an unbaselined match on a non-skipped path outside its named owner? | Gate; clean only when `check-frontier-single-writer` passes. |
| Which named-literal durable-slot mutation sites can the declared derivations resolve? | Native source census, with unresolved sites counted. |
| Is there exactly one live chain-truth writer and one owner for every durable fact? | **UNPROVEN across the whole tree.** Requires typed ownership and runtime/fault evidence, not another path allowlist. |

Do not call the rescue complete from either source scan. Select new work from
[`work/FORWARD_PLAN.md`](work/FORWARD_PLAN.md), use the invariants above as the
design constraint, and attach evidence only to the exact surface each gate or
test observes.
