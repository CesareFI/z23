# Bounded C23 procedures and unambiguous selection

## Intention and exact scope

Extend template-driven C23 production using the existing compiled prompt
selector, template identity and receipt path. The source base is
`ed3b192029bbe4fc9df534a26fb021cc84993f6d`. The change adds
`c23-wire-codec`, `c23-cas-operation` and `c23-service-operation` to
`engine/composition/prompt_templates.def`, extends the registered `engine`
selection fixture, and updates `docs/work/C23_TASK_CATALOG.md`.
The canonical generator also refreshes the source-root identity in
`docs/CAPABILITY_INVENTORY.jsonl`.

Each procedure specifies required task inputs, a real source exemplar,
implementation order, ownership/refusal behavior and production-caller
acceptance. Only the selected procedure enters a prompt. The existing
1800-byte per-procedure test applies to both additions. Template identities
continue through the existing canonical serialization and CAS path; this
change creates no scheduler, task authority or evidence store.

The compiled-template lint gate now rejects duplicate `(kind, section)` rows.
Previously the lookup selected one body while template identity included all
rows. The new production scanner reports the conflicting kind and section;
self-tests cover identical and different duplicate bodies and valid distinct
pairs. The change preserves existing result codes and bounded diagnostics.

The catalog supplies a compact task card and maps only matching wire and
content-store rows. Signature admission, transfer scheduling, eviction and
index recovery still require their own procedures. Examples guide reuse;
they do not establish that every possible C23 function has a template.

## Verification

- Source inspection verified both exemplar symbols at the exact base.
- The existing local `z23-lint check-prompt-templates` passed: 44 rows,
  11 complete kinds. This is a source gate, not a rebuilt-runner claim.
- `git diff --check` passed before remote qualification.
- The source/test patch transferred to an isolated development-host worktree
  at the exact base with SHA-256
  `ef3e1967d6d0f96f39f1e68b6c0342f32e065c9a702173e34d1e1fabce04d7b9`.
- Host-admitted `make setup` completed. With GCC 14.2.0,
  `devbuild --wait make -j"$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)" t-fast-exact ONLY=engine`
  passed: one cold group, zero failures, zero skips, 4.7 seconds test wall
  time. This excludes dependency preparation and compilation time.
- Both rebuilt production-runner `--dry-run` previews selected the requested
  kind and reported four of four required sections present. No provider call
  was made. Preview checks prompt composition, not whether a worker obeys it
  or whether task-specific input fields are complete.
- At 2026-10-08T18:24:04Z, source hashes matched between local and remote:
  template definition
  `4e05203986970b1b058056168afbb92f4734135b38188fb1614c54d1933a3b33`;
  test source
  `613a293c322eba7bdde83774d4034d18005bf2a55a7a58256c02807d005c3b59`.
- Catalog checks retain 500 unique IDs, with 24 wire and 10 CAS rows selecting
  the new procedures. These are coverage counts, not productivity results.
- The first `lint-fast` run passed 34 of 35 gates and refused the stale
  capability inventory. After host-admitted `make docs-capability-inventory`,
  `devbuild --wait make lint-fast` passed all 35 gates. The generated diff
  changes only the inventory source-root record.
- Logs are retained under `build/handoff/c23-function-recipes/` in the local
  candidate checkout: setup, registered group, both previews, generation,
  initial lint refusal and final lint pass. Full publication proof is NOTRUN.

## Fleet follow-up qualification

Two remote proposals received independent source review before integration:
the service-operation recipe and duplicate-pair lint refusal. Their original
patch SHA-256 identities are respectively
`4e5305c3573619a4549f4c25e032b94e5dfc8872c7400b37f7e2d96bf2de418b`
and `b73a292c130ab4f17f63624a15ec4dd18338aa931af485056106db156f05011e`.
The service recipe was combined with the earlier additions at their shared
insertion points; the original patch is not the combined candidate identity.

On 2026-10-08 the host-admitted rebuilt prompt gate passed with 48 rows and
12 complete kinds. Its self-test passed. The registered `engine` group passed
with zero failures and zero skips in 35.1 seconds test wall time. These checks
qualify selection and fixtures, not measured provider savings or publication.
The duplicate-check mutation compiled; the unchanged self-test exited 1.
After reverse application, the rebuilt gate and self-test passed. Restored
`gate_def_parsers.c` SHA-256 was
`a1898c6b645530071cb6a4b26d4984ff094e076e94d7c68b6df2d378eee3a5c0`.
After canonical inventory regeneration, host-admitted `lint-fast` passed for
the combined candidate. Follow-up logs are retained with the earlier evidence.
Exact publication proof and publication remain NOTRUN.

## Efficiency experiment still required

Freeze a matched cohort of real root tasks and acceptance policies. Compare
the existing workflow with the selected procedure while retaining identical
source context, model configuration and independent review obligations.
Include discovery, generation, tests, review, repair, rejected attempts and
integration in total usage. Bind observations to exact task, candidate,
template and policy identities through existing authorities. Missing usage
remains unknown; splitting tasks cannot increase the accepted-output count.

Report complete tokens per accepted task, first-attempt acceptance,
end-to-end latency, escaped defects and accounting coverage. Functional
selection and bounded text do not demonstrate savings. Provider-token
comparison, fleet recovery, independent review and publication are NOTRUN.
